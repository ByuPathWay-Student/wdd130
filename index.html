        <p>Hello I am Adeline Scott! I live in the United States of America. I enjoy music, volleyball, and being with
            my family. I like to draw, create, and pretty much
            anything to do with art. I love all animals, but some of my favorite animals are cats, dogs, chinchillas,
            and rabbits. I also love the ocean and the mountains, and enjoy being outside. I am excited to learn web
            development, being able to design websites
            is something I've always wanted to learn. My dad and brother both can code, and I think that is what made me
            want to learn how. I am
            also excited to learn new things, expand my knowledge, and learn and grow. Once I am out of school,
            I'm hoping to be either become a graphic designer or a frontend web developer, or possibly even both.
        </p>
